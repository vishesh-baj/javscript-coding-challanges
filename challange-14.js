// ? 1. Loop over the'dogs'array containing dog objects,and for each dog,calculate the recommended food portion and add it to the object as a new property. Do not create a new array, simply loop over the array. Forumla: recommendedFood = weight ** 0.75 * 28. (The result is in grams of food, and the weight needs to be in kg)

// ? 2. Find Sarah's dog and log to the console whether it's eating too much or too little. Hint: Some dogs have multiple owners, so you first need to find Sarah in the owners array, and so this one is a bit tricky

console.log(`${ownersEatTooMuch.join(" and ")}'s dog eat too much!`);
console.log(`${ownersEatTooLittle.join(" and ")}'s dog eat too little!`);

// ? 5. Log to the console whether there is any dog eating exactly the amount of food that is recommended (just true or false)

console.log(dogs.some((dog) => dog.curFood === dog.recomendedPortion));

// ? 6. Log to the console whether there is any dog eating an okay amount of food (just true or false)
console.log(dogs.some((dog) => dog.foodStatus === 0));

// ? 7. Create an array containing the dogs that are eating an okay amount of food(try to reuse the condition used in 6.)
console.log(dogs.find((dog) => dog.foodStatus === 0));
// ? 8. Create a shallow copy of the'dogs'array and sort it by recommended food portion in an ascending order (keep in mind that the portions are inside the array's objects ðŸ˜‰)
